 Motives for using Docker
------------------------

-   Difficulty of managing dependencies
-   Maximizing isolation and transparency
-   Portability of computational environment
-   Make extendibility and reuse easy
-   Ease of use generally

 Limitations of VMs
------------------

-   **Size**: VMs are large files which makes them impractical to store
    and transfer
-   **Performance**: running VMs consumes significant CPU and memory

 What Docker is
--------------

-   A shipping container for the online universe: hardware-agnostic and
    platform-agnostic
-   A tool that lets programmers neatly package software and move it
    from machine to machine.
-   Released as open source in March 2013, a big deal on github: 18.6k
    stars, 3.8k forks
    



 Basic ingredients
-----------------

-   **[dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/)**:
    plain-text instructions to automatically make images
-   **containers**: the active, running parts of Docker that do
    something
-   **images**: pre-built environments and instructions that tell a
    container what to do.
-   **registry**: [open online repository of
    images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/), including many ['trusted
    builds'](http://dockerfile.github.io/)

 Docker's limitations
--------------------

-   Security: it is possible for a hosted image to be written with some
    malicious intent
-   Limited to 64-bit host machines, making it impossible to run on
    older hardware
-   Does not provide complete virtualization but relies on the Linux
    kernel provided by the host
-   On OSX and Windows this means a VM must be present
    ([boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) installs
    [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for this)

 Getting started on OSX & Windows
--------------------------------

-   Install & start [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/)
-   `docker pull <username>/<image_name>` gets an existing image from
    registry
-   eg. `docker pull ubuntu` notice there's no username here, because
    this is an 'official repo'
-   after `docker pull` then `docker run`
-   or simply `docker run`, which will `pull`, `create` and `run` in one
    step

 Common [arguments](https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/) for `docker run`:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ------------------ | ----------------------    
  -i                 | Interactive (usually used with -t)
  -t                 | Give a terminal interface for a CLI
  -p                 | Publish Ports: `-p <host port>:<container port>`
  -d                 | Detached mode: run the container in the background (opposite of -i -t)
  -v                 | Mount a volume from inside your container (that has been specified with the VOLUME instruction in the Dockerfile)
  -rm=true           | Remove your container from the host when it stops running (only available with -it)



 Examples of `docker run`
------------------------

-   `docker run -it ubuntu`
-   gets ubuntu and gives us a terminal for interaction
-   `docker run -dp 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio`
-   gets R & RStudio and opens port 8787 for using RStudio server in a
    web browser at localhost:8787 (linux) or 192.168.59.103:8787
    (Windows, OSX)

 [Interacting with docker at the command line](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
-----------------------------------------------  

  ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------    
  `docker ps`                                 | list all the running containers on the host
  `docker ps -a`                              | list all the containers on the host, including those that have stopped
  `docker exec -it <container-id> bash`       | opens bash shell for a currently running container
  `docker stop <container-id>`                | stop a running container
  `docker kill <container-id>`                | force stop a running container

  
 [Interacting with docker at the command line](https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/)
-----------------------------------------------  

  ------------------------------------------ | -----------------------------------    
  `docker rm <container-id>`                 | removes (deletes) a container
  `docker rmi <container-id>`                | removes (deletes) an image
  `docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)`          | remove all current containers
  `docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)`        | remove all images, even those not in use

  


 [Writing a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   It is possible to use `docker commit <container>` to commit a
    container's file changes or settings into a new image
-   But it is better to use Dockerfiles & git to manage your images in a
    documented and maintainable way
-   A Dockerfile is a short plain text file that is a recipie for making
    a docker image

 Some common Dockerfile elements
-------------------------------

-   FROM specifies which base image your image is built on
    (ultimately back to Debian)
-   MAINTAINER specifies who created and maintains the
    image.
-   CMD specifies the command to run immediately when a container is
    started from this image, unless you specify a different command.
-   ADD will copy new files from a source and add them to
    the containers filesystem path
-   RUN does just that: It runs a command inside the
    container (eg. `apt-get`)
-   EXPOSE tells Docker that the container will listen on
    the specified port when it starts
-   VOLUME will create a mount point with the specified name
    and tell Docker that the volume may be mounted by the host

 Using Dockerfiles
-----------------

-   To build an image from a dockerfile:
    `docker build --rm -t <username>/<image_name> <dockerfile>`
-   [simple](https://github.com/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjebebe/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    and [moderately
    complex](https://github.com/rocker-org/hadleyverse/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    examples
-   To send an image to the registry:
    `docker push <username>/<image_name>` You need to be registered at
    the [hub](https://hub.docker.com/) bfore pushing

 [Automated Docker image build testing](https://circleci.com/)
-------------------------------------------------------------

-   Automated image build testing on a new commit to the Dockerfile
-   Analogous to the travis-ci service, has a shield
-   Requires a `.circle.yml` file in github repo, eg.
    [https://github.com/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjebebe/blob/master/circle.yml](https://github.com/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjebebe/blob/master/circle.yml)
-   Pushes new image to hub on successful complete of test
-   And gives a
    [badge](https://github.com/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjebebe)
    to indicate [test
    status](https://circleci.com/gh/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjebebe)

 Doing research with RStudio and Docker
--------------------------------------

-   The [rocker project](https://github.com/rocker-org/) provides images
    that include R, key packages and other dependencies (RStudio,
    pandoc, LaTeX, etc.), and has excellent documentation on the [github
    wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image)
-   I run RStudio server in the browser, with host folder as volume,
    very easy to use
-   I store scripts on host volume because VC is simpler this way, but
    do development and analysis in container for isolation

 I get started with... 
--------------------------------------

`docker run -dp 8787:8787 -v /c/Users/marwick/docker:/home/rstudio/ -e ROOT=TRUE rocker/hadleyverse`

-   `-dp 8787:8787` gives me a port for the web browser to access
    RStudio
-   `-v /c/Users/marwick/docker:/home/rstudio/` gives me read and write
    access both ways between Windows (C:/Users/marwick/docker) and
    RStudio
-   `-e ROOT=TRUE` sets an environment variable to enable root access
    for me so I can manage dependencies
-   I can access the docker (Debian) shell via RStudio for file
    manipulation, etc. (or `docker exec -it <container-id> bash`)

 ...and IPython
------------

-   Choose your favourite from the
    [registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=ipython&s=downloads)
-   the IPython project have a few images, and there are many
    user-contributed ones

 Cloud computing with Docker is widely supported
-----------------------------------------------

-   Amazon EC2 Container Service: docker clusters in the cloud (no
    registry)
-   Google Compute Engine: has container-optimized VMs
-   Google container registry: secure private docker image storage on
    google cloud platform
-   Microsoft Azure supports docker containers (docker hub is
    integrated)
